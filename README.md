# Python_Selenium
You can automate some processes with selenium in Python.


First make sure you have already installed pip. If not:

curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py

python get-pip.py


Second, install selenium for python:

pip install selenium

Third, decide which browser you will use. If you want to use Chrome, you should download chromedriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads .
Check your chrome browser's version and download that driver version.
